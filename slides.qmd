## Structure

::: {.incremental}
- What is literate programming?
- Very short history
- Intro to markdown
    - formatting basics
    - tables, figures, references...
- Adding code
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed
- Suitable text editor or IDE
    - I will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) (and presumably other software) works well too
- Quarto [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) for VS Code
- Curiosity, patience, and trust that it's gonna be worth it

::: {.aside}
Other software will be installed as we go
