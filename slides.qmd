## Structure

::: {.incremental}
- What is literate programming?
- Very short history
- Intro to markdown
    - formatting basics
    - tables, figures, references...
- Adding code
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed
- Suitable text editor or IDE
- I will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) (and presumably other software) works well too
- Quarto [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) for VS Code
- Curiosity, patience, and trust that it's gonna be worth it

::: {.aside}
Other software will be installed as we go

## Quarto

- Created by Posit (formerly RStudio)
- Grew out of `knitr` and R Markdown (Rmd)
    - markdown-based text editor with powerful `R` code evaluation capability
    - Became super popular in the R community (`rmarkdown`, `blogdown`, `bookdown`)
- Extends Rmd to natively support Python, Julia, and [Observable JS](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/)
- For Python and Julia, Quarto is essentially just a better Jupyter Notebook

## In practice

I've used R Markdown extensively in my teaching

## Enough chit chat

Let's see what the fuss is all about!
